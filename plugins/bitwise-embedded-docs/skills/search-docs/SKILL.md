description: Search embedded systems documentation for registers, memory maps, and peripheral details
---

Search the indexed embedded systems documentation for the user's query. Use the `search_docs` MCP tool to find relevant sections, register definitions, and memory map information from ingested PDF datasheets.

If the user is looking for a specific register by name, prefer `find_register` for exact matches.

If no documents are indexed yet, suggest using `ingest_docs` first with the path to a PDF datasheet.
